KNOWN ISSUES
------------

- Cannot write pidlock on remote slave with SUDO_EXEC=yes but insufficient rights (sudo does not work for command echo)
- If master and remote slave aren't the same distros and rsync binary isn't in the same path, execution may fail (RSYNC_PATH should be configurable)
- Possible non delete status for a file with space in name on master replica from slave remote replica
